# Share Positive Energy (SPE) ‚òÄÔ∏è

**Share Positive Energy** is a platform designed to make it easier (and safer) for people to leave kind, supportive, or constructive feedback ‚Äî anonymously. In a world where negativity is often louder, SPE encourages small, positive acts of emotional generosity.

The idea: Give users a space to highlight the good in others ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs encouragement, gratitude, or meaningful reflection ‚Äî and let those words live on their wall. No likes, no scoring. Just real words from real people.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (modular components, optimistic UI, reusable feedback cards)
- **Backend**: Django + Django REST Framework (user auth, feedback API, admin controls)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Design**: [Figma Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/design/7CgwVnAJ6EEIadtp2mGtWo/Feedbacker?node-id=0-1&t=TWIsjeyYFeWTct3b-1)
- **Hosting**: AWS EC2 (Free Tier; currently paused to avoid overage charges)

This MVP was initially deployed on an EC2 instance to test user interactions and gather early feedback. Based on that feedback and market research, I'm iterating on the next version to better meet user expectations and improve experience, moderation, and onboarding.
